###High Priority:
1) to plot the most important plasma parameters for kinetic simulations using local parameters (beta, n, grad(n), T,
      grad(T), backgroud B, B fluctuation, delta background B, etc). That would help to ensure validity
      of gk codes on that region.
      partially done, now need to do the same for density, temperature, and compute beta using B and plasmapy

      Get rid of printing all variable everytime something is plotted.

3) THERE IS SOME PROBLEM WITH DISPLAYING MMS PLOTS. (SAVING IS STILL FINE BUT THE ERROR PERSISTS)
    IT LOOKS LIKE ALL PLOTS ARE THE SAME ? MAYBE RELOAD PYCHARM?
    SEEM TO BE FIXED -> TEST TOMORROW (OR THURSDAY) AND PROCEED WITH TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

2) MOVE TOWARDS TIME SERIES DATA ANALYSIS ASAP!!! Start with B Spectral Analysis?


###Middle Priority:
1) Double test mms download, reliability, etc...
2) Double check why orbit looks messed up and try to also plot the magnetopause T96. (orbit2D should be a separated
    class with the T96 property, still check for proper time_range usage)
3) Orbit2D T98 magnetopause issue still persists!!!
4) Organize the downloaded_data file structure, locally and how the functions are creating those files.
5) Pydata (from when when uses mms download) should be saved inside data files, not in local dir.
6) New file, class where the user can explore the metadata of the cdf downloaded


###Lower Priority:
1) Select Plot Action windows needs to close the old one and open a new one, otherwise they accumulate and stack
    on top of each other.
2) Find a way to plot the best fit of the 3D magnetopause's fixed parameters using the T96 dynamic curve
    generated with mp_dat = pytplot.get_data('mpause_gse_hi')
3) Add option to explore CDF properties of downloaded files
4) Add magnetic reconnection from old jupyter notebook (like in florians paper)
5) Add field particle correlation
6) clear way to make ones own plot
